# LoneLight

LoneLight is an interactive underwater world made using Unity (c#) for the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion platform. 

The objective of the game is to help a spirit light up a ruin inside the ocean. The ruin has been destroyed by a sea monster as it likes to live in darkness and hates light. You as a guest have to follow the spirit along a path to light up the environment and fight the monster with a spear along the way. The interaction involves both hands as well as spatial movement. You can use your hands to swim around and stab the monster with the spear.
